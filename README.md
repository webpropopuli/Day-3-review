In your Cloud9, git init a repo for Day 3 Review; this should have a file inside it with your first and last name, and your goals as a developer, and a README file in standard format explaining the assignment. Push it to GitHub

git remote add origin [your-url]
git push -u origin master

Create a branch of the git with your goals as a developer replaced with your main takewaways from the class from our time together so far.

Post the link to your repository in the “Work” section of this assignment and mark as done.

PHASE II
Find a partner. Both partners create a file that includes your own first and last name
